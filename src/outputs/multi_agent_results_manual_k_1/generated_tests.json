The unittest output shows \"Lists differ\" with the first differing element reported for each failing test. The failing tests are:\n  - test_arrangementcalculator\n  - test_select_1\n  - test_select_2\n  - test_select_3\n  - test_select_all_1\n  - test_select_all_2\n  - test_select_all_4\n\n Root cause (observed): The implementation calls set(...) to remove duplicate permutations in select(), which discards ordering. The test suite expects a specific order of permutations/selections; converting to a set changes the order (and possibly reorders elements), causing list-equality assertions to fail even when the contents are otherwise correct.\n\n Suggested fix (brief): Preserve original ordering when deduplicating (e.g., use dict.fromkeys on tuple(item) to keep insertion order, or avoid using set and instead filter duplicates while maintaining order), or explicitly sort the results into the expected deterministic order before returning.\n```",
  "AssessmentSystem": "```test_results\nTest Summary:\n-TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS EXECUTED: 31\n-PASSED: 6\n-FAILED: 6\n-ERRORS: 19\n\n-SUMMARY OF ERRORS:\n  - The test run produced many AttributeError exceptions: \"AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'courses'\".\n    - These occur when methods access student.courses (e.g., in add_course_score, get_gpa, get_all_students_with_fail_course, get_course_average, get_top_student).\n    - Root cause: the test harness expects the AssessmentSystem.students mapping to contain plain dicts (with a 'courses' key) and in some tests it assigns such dicts directly. The translated code uses Student objects and attribute access (student.courses), causing a mismatch and AttributeError when a dict is present.\n  - Several assertion failures stem from type/structure mismatch: tests expect student entries to be dictionaries like {'name':..., 'grade':..., 'major':..., 'courses': {...}}, while the implementation stores Student instances. Examples: add_student tests and the main test compare the mapping contents to dicts and fail.\n  - Overall: behaviorally the implementation uses a Student class (objects with attributes) but the tests assume/operate on student dictionaries. This structural mismatch is the primary cause of both the AttributeErrors and the assertion failures.\n\n-EXAMPLE failing tests (not exhaustive):\n  - Errors: test_add_course_score, test_get_all_students_with_fail_course, test_get_course_average_1, test_get_gpa_1, test_get_top_student, ...\n  - Failures: test_add_student, test_add_student_2, test_add_student_3, test_add_student_4, test_add_student_5, test_main\n\n```",

This name mismatch causes multiple tests to error when calling the expected method.\n\n  2) AttributeError: 'dict' object has no attribute 'get_name' (and similarly 'get_major')\n     - Several failures originate in methods that iterate self.students expecting Student objects (calling get_name()/get_major()), but a dict was encountered in self.students.

This is likely the root cause for the failing write_xml_* and process_xml_data_* tests (process_xml_data calls write_xml at the end).\n - The single error traceback (test_read_xml_6) is a FileNotFoundError from ET.parse when attempting to open a file with an empty filename: FileNotFoundError: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''. This caused that test to error rather than fail.\n\n-UNITTEST SUMMARY LINE:\n Ran 23 tests in 0.031s\n FAILED (failures=10, errors=1)\n```",

The read_zip_file implementation returns a ZipFileInfo instance that lacks zipfile-like methods (e.g., close()). Tests expect a ZipFile-like object or an object implementing close(), causing AttributeError when tests call close().\n\n- OSError: [WinError 145] The directory is not empty: 'test_folder'\n  - Raised during test cleanup (os.rmdir). This indicates test_folder still contained files (leftover from extraction or zip creation) so removal failed. This points to extraction/create methods not leaving the filesystem in the state tests expect.\n\n- Logged errors observed in test output:\n  - \"Error creating zip file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''\"\n  - \"Error reading zip file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''\"\n  These were printed by the code in some test cases (but those particular tests returned 'ok' despite the messages). They suggest the code did not properly validate or handle empty path inputs.\n\n-RECOMMENDATIONS (brief):\n- Modify read_zip_file to return a zipfile.ZipFile (or an object with close()) or ensure ZipFileInfo implements close()/context management expected by tests.\n- Ensure create_zip_file and extraction methods handle empty paths and create/remove files/directories as tests expect (and clean up after themselves).\n- Investigate and ensure tests' cleanup code can remove created files (or remove created files before attempting os.rmdir).\n\n```"

Add_student should include the 'name' field in the stored dict to satisfy the tests.\n\n- test_add_course_score_5 raised a ValueError when adding a score for \"Bob\" because the student did not exist. The test expected a different behavior (no exception), so behavior expectations differ: either the implementation should auto-create the student or the tests should expect an error. Currently the implementation raises for non-existent students.\n\n- test_get_course_average_2 failed with a TypeError because at least one student's course entry has a None score, causing total += None to fail when computing course average. The implementation does not guard against None-valued scores; it should validate/ignore None scores (or tests should not insert None).\n\nOverall: 23 passing, 8 problematic (6 fails, 2 errors). The main actionable fixes are:\n- Include 'name' in the student dict created by add_student.\n- Decide on desired behavior when adding a course score for a non-existent student (either auto-create or keep raising) to match tests.\n- Handle None scores in get_course_average (skip None or raise a clear error).\n\n```",

The logic that slices the input and when it appends tokens is incorrect.\n\n  3) compare() tests failing\n     - Several compare tests assert different precedence outcomes; current compare() returns operat_priority[peek] > operat_priority[cur]\n       which appears to have the wrong comparison direction or doesn't handle equal-precedence cases per test expectations.\n\n  4) _calculate() type errors\n     - Tests call _calculate() with string arguments (e.g. \"3\", \"2\") and current implementation expects floats; operations are applied to strings causing TypeError.\n     - Solution: convert inputs to float (or accept numeric types) inside _calculate before applying operations.\n\n  5) test_calculate_method_1 NameError: Decimal is not defined\n     - This error occurs inside the test suite (they expect Decimal in assertion). It's likely a minor test harness issue; however it surfaced after other errors. (Not caused by code under test.)\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- The main functional failures originate in prepare() (postfix conversion) and compare() (precedence comparison). These cause evaluation to receive bad postfix tokens and lead to IndexError during calculation. Additionally, _calculate() should coerce inputs to numeric types to avoid TypeErrors when test calls pass strings.\n\nRecommended fixes:\n- In prepare():\n  - Parse and append only the numeric token substrings (not expression[:i] or other prefixes).\n  - Ensure tokens and operators are pushed to postfix_stack in correct postfix order.\n  - Re-check the handling of signs and scientific notation, and the loop index increments/continuation logic.\n\n- In compare():\n  - Re-evaluate the comparison condition to match expected behavior (consider >= or correct direction).\n\n- In _calculate():\n  - Convert first_value and second_value to float before applying operator functions (or validate types).\n\nOnce those are fixed, re-run the tests to see remaining issues (if any).\n\n```",

Likely causes:\n    - The averaging divides by len(data) (the total number of top-level items) even when some entries are invalid/skipped, rather than dividing by the number of valid entries that contributed to the sum.\n    - The functions may also not handle the case when a single pair (tuple) is provided instead of an iterable of pairs, leading to early errors or incorrect accumulation.\n\nRECOMMENDED FIXES (concise):\n- Make the API accept either a single (vec, k) pair or an iterable of such pairs. For example:\n  - If isinstance(data, tuple) and len(data) == 2 and not isinstance(data[0], (list, tuple, set)), treat it as a single pair.\n  - Or normalize: if data and (not hasattr(data, '__iter__') or isinstance(data[0], (int,))): wrap it in a list.\n- When computing averages, divide by the number of valid entries that contributed to the sum (i.e., count only entries with k > 0 and non-empty vec for mrr, or total_num > 0 for map), not by len(data).\n- Verify map calculation uses total_num appropriately if required by spec; ensure _calculate_map returns the expected AP and the aggregator averages it over valid items.\n\nComplete error traces and failing assertion values are available in the test run output (errors + assertion mismatch lines shown during execution).\n```",

This causes exact equality assertions to fail.\n- correlation() returns NaN for zero-variance inputs, while tests expect None for those cases.\n- correlation_matrix() entries are NumPy float types (np.float64) and NaN values; tests expect plain Python floats (e.g., 1.0) or None for invalid entries.\n- mean([]) currently returns NaN; tests expect None for empty input (test_mean_2).\n- z_score() returns lists of NaN (sometimes np.float64 nan) for constant or too-short data; tests expect None in several of these cases.\n\nOverall, failures cluster around type/representation differences (np.float64 vs python float), NaN vs None semantics, and a few floating-point rounding differences producing values not exactly equal to expected literals (1.0). Fixes should normalize return types to native Python floats where appropriate and return None instead of NaN for the test-expected edge cases (empty inputs, zero variance, or insufficient data), or adjust equality handling to tolerate floating error where exact 1.0 is intended.\n```",

Root cause indication:\n  - Code assumes portfolio items are Stock instances (accessing .name, .price, .quantity), but tests sometimes provide or compare against plain dicts (e.g., {\"name\":..., \"price\":..., \"quantity\":...}).\n  - Stock.__eq__ also assumes the other operand is a Stock-like object with attributes, causing errors when comparing Stock instances to dicts in test assertions.\n\nSuggested fixes (not applied here):\n  - Make __eq__ robust to compare to dicts (handle dict other by comparing keys), or\n  - Ensure portfolio always stores Stock instances and convert any existing dict entries before operations, or\n  - Adjust methods that iterate portfolio to normalize items via _ensure_stock_object before accessing attributes.\n\n```",

The tracebacks show the test expects query/search results to be sequences (tuples) indexed by integer positions, but the implementation of search_student_by_name returns a list of dictionaries (with keys like \"id\", \"name\", \"age\", \"gender\", \"grade\"). Indexing a dict with an integer (1) raises KeyError. Concretely, tests fail when they do result[0][1] because result[0] is a dict rather than a tuple/sequence.\n\n- RECOMMENDATION:\n  Make the query/search methods return rows in the format expected by the tests (e.g., raw tuples as returned by cursor.fetchall()), or adjust the tests to use dictionary-style access. The failing tests specifically indicate search_student_by_name (and related expectations in StudentDatabaseProcessorTest) need to return tuple rows instead of dicts to satisfy the current test suite.\n```",

The code does not handle dict-style inputs.\n\n  2) AttributeError: 'method_descriptor' object has no attribute 'today'\n     - Occurred in tests: test_filter_5, test_filter_6, test_filter_7, test_filter_8, test_get_jwt_user_1, test_get_jwt_user_2, test_get_jwt_user_3, test_get_jwt_user_4, test_get_jwt_user_5\n     - Cause: The translated code uses \"from datetime import datetime, timedelta\", so the name datetime in the module refers to the datetime class, not the datetime module. The tests call datetime.date.today() (expecting datetime to be the module), which raises AttributeError.\n\n-SUGGESTED FIXES (concise):\n  - Make the filter and helper methods accept both dict-style requests and object-style requests (e.g., check for attributes and fallback to dict keys).\n  - Change the import to \"import datetime\" (or also import the module) so datetime.date.today() in tests works, or update code to use datetime.datetime and datetime.timedelta consistently.\n\n```",

Either provide an alias _convert_type or rename accordingly.\n\n  2) add_argument stores wrong type representations\n     - Failure examples: tests expecting types like {\"name\": str, \"age\": int} but got {'name': 'string', 'age': <class 'int'>}\n     - Cause: add_argument stores the arg_type string \"string\" rather than the actual Python type object (str). Tests expect actual types: str, int, bool.\n\n  3) parse_arguments returns an empty set instead of None when no missing args\n     - Failures: ArgumentParserTestParseArguments.test_parse_arguments_1, _2, _4, _5 reported missing_args equal to set() when tests expect None.\n     - Cause: when no required args are missing, the code returns an empty set rather than None (tests expect missing_args to be None in that case).\n\n  4) parse_arguments input-reading logic is buggy\n     - Failures including parse-related tests and main: the code uses StringIO and calls iss.readline() multiple times in the same expression, causing input lines to be consumed twice and incorrect parsing of short flags and values.\n     - Effects seen: incorrect parsing of short flags, values, and overall missing arguments.\n\n  5) Type conversion behavior partly implemented but mismatches test expectations\n     - Tests expect type mappings to use Python types (int, bool) and conversion helper accessible via the expected method name; current converters are present but tied to string keys and convert_type method. Combined with (1) and (2), conversion tests error or fail.\n\n-RECOMMENDED FIXES (high level):\n  - Provide a method _convert_type (or alias convert_type to _convert_type) to satisfy tests.\n  - Change add_argument to store actual Python type objects (e.g., str, int, bool) rather than strings like \"string\".\n  - Adjust parse_arguments to:\n    - Read tokens from the command string without calling readline() multiple times in a single expression (use a proper tokenizer or split).\n    - Return missing_args as None when there are no missing required arguments (to match tests).\n  - Ensure type conversion uses the stored Python type objects or adjust tests' expected mapping accordingly.\n\n```",

Repeated AttributeError: \"'dict' object has no attribute 'courses'\"\n     - Occurred in many tests (e.g., tests for add_course_score, get_gpa, get_all_students_with_fail_course, get_course_average, get_top_student).\n     - Root cause (from trace): code attempted to access .courses on objects taken from assessment_system.students, but those entries were dicts in the test setup, so .courses attribute did not exist.\n  2. AssertionError comparing stored student representation:\n     - Several tests (add_student family and main) expected assessment_system.students to contain plain dict structures like {'name': ..., 'grade': ..., 'major': ..., 'courses': {...}} but actual code inserted Student instances (<__main__.Student object ...>), causing assertion mismatches.\n\nOverall: Most errors stem from a mismatch between the tests' expected student-data representation (plain dicts) and the implementation (Student objects with a .courses attribute), causing both AttributeErrors and assertion failures.\n```",
  "AutomaticGuitarSimulator": "```test_results\nTest Summary:\n- TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS EXECUTED: 15\n- PASSED: 0\n- FAILED: 10\n- ERRORED: 5\n\nSummary of error messages / root causes:\n- AttributeError in display tests:\n  \"AttributeError: 'AutomaticGuitarSimulator' object has no attribute 'display'\"\n  -> The tests expect a display() method on AutomaticGuitarSimulator, but the translated code only provides format_display() and uses an interpret(display=True) flag to print. This causes all display-related tests to error out.\n\n- Type / structure mismatches (AssertionError):\n  \"Lists differ: [<__main__.PlayItem object ...>] != [{'Chord': 'C', 'Tune': '53231323'}]\"\n  -> interpret() currently returns a list of PlayItem instances. The tests expect a list of dictionaries with keys 'Chord' and 'Tune'. This causes many assertion failures.\n\n- Tokenization / empty-segment behavior (AssertionError):\n  \"Lists differ: [] != [{'Chord': '', 'Tune': ''}, {'Chord': '', 'Tune': ''}]\"\n  -> The code uses str.split() which removes empty segments. Tests expect empty tokens to be returned as items with empty chord/tune fields for certain inputs.\n\n- Unexpected return for empty input (AssertionError):\n  \"AssertionError: [] is not None\"\n  -> For a specific test (test_interpret_9) the tests expect None but interpret() returns an empty list for falsy/empty play_text.\n\nAdditional observed output:\n- The code prints the formatted display string when interpret(display=True): \"Normal Guitar Playing -- Chord: C, Play Tune: 53231323\" (seen in stdout).\n\nOverall conclusion:\n- No tests passed. Fixes needed:\n  1) Add a display(chord, tune) method matching the expected signature or adapt to the tests' expectations.\n  2) Have interpret() return lists of dictionaries with keys 'Chord' and 'Tune' (not PlayItem objects).\n  3) Adjust splitting/tokenization so empty segments are preserved when required by tests.\n  4) Match the expected return value for empty or None input (None vs empty list) as per the test suite.\n```",

These should be handled by rounding or using an approximate comparison (or returning exactly 1.0 when mathematically appropriate).\n  - Several failures arise from inconsistent handling of degenerate cases (empty lists, single-element lists, or zero-variance vectors): the implementation returns float('nan') or lists of nan, while the tests expect None for those cases. The code should return None in these degenerate situations to match the test expectations.\n  - correlation_matrix propagates the above correlation behavior (both precision and nan vs None differences).\n\nRecommendations to fix code to pass tests:\n  - For mean([]) return None instead of float('nan').\n  - For correlation when denominator is zero, return None (not nan).\n  - For z_score on degenerate inputs (std dev undefined or zero, or insufficient length), return None instead of a list of nan.\n  - For correlation (and correlation_matrix), either format/round results to a stable number of decimal places (e.g., round to 10 or 12 decimals) or return exact 1.0 in perfect-correlation cases to avoid assertEqual float mismatches; alternatively, tests should use approximate comparisons.

This indicates files were created/extracted but not removed before rmdir, or the test expected different behavior.\n\n3) Logged errors printed during test run:\n   - \"Error creating zip file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''\"\n   - \"Error reading zip file: [Errno 2] No such file or directory: ''\"\n   - These point to calls with empty/invalid file paths in some test cases and/or insufficient validation/handling of empty paths by create_zip_file/read_zip_file.\n\nOverall:\n- 4 tests passed (test_*_6 variants), 21 errored.\n- Key actionable issues: make read_zip_file return an object compatible with test expectations (provide a .close() or return zipfile.ZipFile), ensure create_zip_file and extraction methods correctly handle/validate paths and clean up created files so test teardown can remove directories successfully.\n```"

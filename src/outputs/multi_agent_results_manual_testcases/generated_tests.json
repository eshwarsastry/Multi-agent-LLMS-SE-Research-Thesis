Tests expect types to be actual type objects (str, int, bool) rather than the literal strings \"string\"/\"bool\".\n  Example failing assertion: expected {'name': <class 'str'>, 'age': <class 'int'>} but got {'name': 'string', 'age': <class 'int'>}.\n\n- convert_type related failures: convert_type returns string values instead of converted Python types for some inputs. Assertions show values like '25' (string) where 25 (int) was expected, and 'True'/'False' strings where boolean True/False were expected. This indicates the type conversion path is not being invoked or not returning the expected Python types for those cases.\n\n- test_main failure mirrors the add_argument/type issue: expected types like <class 'str'> but found the string 'string' for arg2.\n\n- The stderr/stdout from the test run includes detailed tracebacks for each failing test (AssertionError) and shows there are 10 failing tests total.\n\nSuggested areas to fix:\n1. Ensure add_argument stores actual Python type objects (e.g. str, int, bool) in self.types, not the literal strings like \"string\".\n2. Align type registration and conversion so convert_type looks up converters based on stored type objects (or map the string names to actual types consistently) and returns converted Python values (int, bool) rather than their string representations.\n\n```",

This causes multiple assertion failures in the add_student tests and also one failure in test_main where the overall students dict is compared.\n\n- The error in test_get_course_average_2 is a TypeError:\n  \"unsupported operand type(s) for +=: 'int' and 'NoneType'\"\n  This indicates get_course_average attempted to add a None value to an int when accumulating course scores (i.e., some student's course score is None). The method does not guard against None scores before summing.\n\nNotes / suggestions:\n- add_student should include the 'name' key inside the stored student dictionary if tests expect it.\n- get_course_average should handle or skip None course scores (or tests should not insert None), to avoid TypeError when summing.\n\n```",

As a result, 16 tests error out before exercising the VectorUtil functions.\n\n-IMPACT:\n  The errors appear to be in the test harness (missing import of numpy) rather than in the translated VectorUtil implementation. The compute_idf_weight_dict tests passed, indicating some parts of the implementation are correct, but most vector-related tests could not run due to the NameError.\n\n```",

Fixing read_zip_file() to return an open ZipFile object or to provide the expected interface should resolve the errors.\n```"

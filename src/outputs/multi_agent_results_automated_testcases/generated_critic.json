  "ZipFileProcessor": "```review_block\nOutput Format:\nCode Review Report: ZipFileProcessor Class Implementation\nOverall Score: 7/10\nDetailed Scores:\n- Bugs: 7/10 - The `read_zip_file` method does not return meaningful information about the contents of the zip file. It only returns a `ZipFileInfo` object with the filename and mode, which is not useful for understanding the zip's contents.\n- Transformation: 8/10 - The translation from a conceptual design to Python code is mostly accurate, but there are some improvements that can be made for better functionality and usability.\n- Compliance: 7/10 - The code follows PEP 8 guidelines well, but there are minor issues like unnecessary comments and inconsistent use of spaces around operators.\n- Encoding: 10/10 - The code uses UTF-8 encoding, which is appropriate for handling text data.\n- Type Safety: 6/10 - The code lacks type annotations, which can lead to runtime errors if incorrect types are passed to functions. Adding type hints would improve robustness.\n- Aesthetics: 7/10 - The code is generally readable, but it could benefit from more descriptive variable names and better organization of methods within the class.\n```"

  "AccessGatewayFilter": "Title: Access Gateway Filter\n1. The system should filter requests based on their URI and HTTP method.\n2. Requests starting with \"/api\" or \"/login\" should be allowed without further checks.\n3. For other requests, the system should validate a JWT token included in the request.\n4. The JWT token must contain the user's name at the beginning.\n5. The JWT token must include a timestamp indicating when it was issued.\n6. The JWT token should be considered valid only if it has been issued within the last 72 hours.\n7. If the JWT token is valid, the system should extract user information from the token.\n8. Users with a level greater than 2 should be granted access.\n9. Upon granting access, the system should log the user's name, address, and the current timestamp.",
  "AreaCalculator": "Title: Area Calculator\n1. The system shall provide a class named `AreaCalculator` that calculates areas of various geometric shapes.\n2. The `AreaCalculator` class shall accept a single parameter, `radius`, during initialization and throw an exception if the radius is negative.\n3. The `AreaCalculator` class shall have a method `calculate_circle_area` that returns the area of a circle using the formula πr².\n4. The `AreaCalculator` class shall have a method `calculate_sphere_area` that returns the surface area of a sphere using the formula 4πr².\n5. The `AreaCalculator` class shall have a method `calculate_cylinder_area` that accepts a parameter `height` and returns the surface area of a cylinder using the formula 2πr(r + h), throwing an exception if the height is negative.\n6. The `AreaCalculator` class shall have a method `calculate_sector_area` that accepts a parameter `angle` and returns the area of a sector using the formula 0.5r²θ.\n7. The `AreaCalculator` class shall have a method `calculate_annulus_area` that accepts parameters `inner_radius` and `outer_radius` and returns the area of an annulus using the formula π(R² - r²), throwing an exception if the inner radius is greater than the outer radius.\n8. The system shall define the constant π as 3.14159265358979323846 if it is not already defined.\n9. The system shall include unit tests for each area calculation method using the Google Test framework."

  "AccessGatewayFilter": "Title: Access Gateway Filter\n1. The system should filter requests based on their URI and method.\n2. Requests starting with \"/api\" or \"/login\" should be allowed without further checks.\n3. For other requests, the system should validate a JWT token included in the request.\n4. The JWT token must contain the user's name at the beginning.\n5. The JWT token must include a timestamp that is not older than 72 hours from the current time.\n6. If the JWT token is valid and the user's level is greater than 2, the system should log the user's name, address, and the current timestamp.\n7. The system should handle exceptions during JWT validation and return false if any exception occurs.\n8. The system should support logging of user information to the console."

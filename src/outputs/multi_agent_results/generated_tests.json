  "AccessGatewayFilter": "I executed the provided test run request via the execute_and_compare_tests tool. Results:\n\nTest Summary:\n- TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS EXECUTED: 0\n- C++: 0 passed / 0 failed\n- Python: 0 passed / 0 failed\n- Outcomes match between the two implementations: Yes (no differences reported)\n\nNotes and likely cause:\n- The test runner returned zero executed tests and no detailed results. The C++ test cases were embedded inside the legacy_code string (main + tests), while the cpp_tests parameter was empty; the python tests were provided in py_tests. The execute_and_compare_tests tool returned no executed tests in its response (details empty). This likely indicates the test harness did not pick up or run the tests as provided, or there was an execution error that produced no output.\n\nNext steps I can take (please confirm which you prefer):\n1. Re-run tests after moving the C++ test functions into the cpp_tests parameter (and leaving legacy_code as only the library/program code). I can prepare separate cpp_tests and py_tests strings and call execute_and_compare_tests again.\n2. Use run_and_compare_tests instead, if that fits the available tooling better.\n3. If you want, I can modify the tests (or add more assertions) before attempting another run.\n\nWhich option do you want me to do?",

Possible reasons:\n- The execution environment for the tool cannot compile/run C++/GoogleTest binaries.\n- gtest is not available in the execution environment, so C++ tests could not be run.\n- The tool is a stub (or disabled) and did not actually run the test harness.\n- There was an internal error in the execution service that prevented running tests (no error detail was returned).\n\nWhat I can do next (choose one or more):\n- Re-run the tests (if you want me to call the tool again).\n- Run only the Python unittest suite (I can produce a command to run it locally: python -m unittest <test_file>), or adjust the test harness to run Python tests separately.\n- Provide a CMake-based test runner or a small main() that runs the GoogleTest suite if the environment supports it.\n- If you can provide an environment or allow me to run commands that compile and run C++ with gtest, I can attempt to run them again and provide full results.\n\nWhich would you like me to do next?"

  "AccessGatewayFilter": "Code Review Report: Access Gateway Filter Implementation\nOverall Score: 7/10\nDetailed Scores:\n- Bugs: 7/10 - The code does not handle cases where the JWT token might be malformed or missing. It also assumes that the JWT timestamp is always a valid float, which may not be the case.\n- Transformation: 8/10 - The translation from C++ to Python is mostly accurate, but there are minor differences in exception handling and string manipulation methods.\n- Compliance: 6/10 - The code does not follow PEP 8 guidelines for naming conventions and spacing. Additionally, it lacks proper documentation and comments.\n- Encoding: 10/10 - The code uses UTF-8 encoding, which is appropriate for both Python and C++ implementations.\n- Type Safety: 5/10 - Python is dynamically typed, but the code could benefit from type hints to improve readability and maintainability. In C++, the use of `std::string` and `int` types is appropriate, but there should be more robust error checking.\n- Aesthetics: 6/10 - The code is generally readable, but it could be improved by adhering to PEP 8 guidelines and adding comments to explain the purpose of each function and critical sections of the code.",
  "AreaCalculator": "Code Review Report: AreaCalculator\nOverall Score: 7/10\nDetailed Scores:\n- Bugs: 7/10 - The `calculate_sector_area` method assumes the angle is in radians, which might not be clear to users. Consider adding documentation or an option to specify the angle unit.\n- Transformation: 8/10 - The code is well-structured and follows object-oriented principles. However, the naming of `calculate_cylinder_area` might be misleading as it calculates the lateral surface area of a cylinder, not the total surface area.\n- Compliance: 7/10 - The code adheres to Python conventions but lacks comprehensive docstrings and comments. Adding these would improve readability and maintainability.\n- Encoding: 10/10 - The code uses UTF-8 encoding, which is appropriate for Python.\n- Type Safety: 6/10 - While the code checks for negative values, it does not enforce type checking. Using type hints could help prevent incorrect data types from being passed.\n- Aesthetics: 8/10 - The code is generally clean and follows PEP 8 guidelines. However, some methods could benefit from more descriptive variable names and spacing around operators for clarity."

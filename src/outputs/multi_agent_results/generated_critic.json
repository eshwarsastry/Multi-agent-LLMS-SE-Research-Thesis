  "Warehouse": "```review_block\nOutput Format:\nCode Review Report: Warehouse Management System\nOverall Score: 8/10\nDetailed Scores:\n- Bugs: 8/10 - The code handles basic scenarios correctly, but there's no handling for negative quantities when adding products.\n- Transformation: 9/10 - The translation from C++ tests to Python tests is accurate and covers all necessary cases.\n- Compliance: 7/10 - The code follows good practices but could benefit from more detailed comments and docstrings.\n- Encoding: 10/10 - The code is well-encoded with no syntax errors.\n- Type Safety: 6/10 - Python does not enforce type safety, but the code assumes correct types; adding type hints would improve this.\n- Aesthetics: 8/10 - The code is readable and follows PEP 8 guidelines, but some methods could be refactored for clarity.\n```",
  "WeatherSystem": "```review_block\nOutput Format:\nCode Review Report: Weather System Implementation\nOverall Score: 8/10\nDetailed Scores:\n- Bugs: 8/10 - The implementation seems correct based on the provided tests, but there's no error handling for invalid temperature units.\n- Transformation: 9/10 - The code is well-structured and logically follows the requirements, with clear separation of concerns.\n- Compliance: 7/10 - The code adheres to Python conventions, but could benefit from more descriptive variable names and docstrings.\n- Encoding: 10/10 - The code uses UTF-8 encoding, which is standard and appropriate.\n- Type Safety: 6/10 - Python is dynamically typed, but the code could use type hints to improve clarity and catch potential errors.\n- Aesthetics: 7/10 - The code is generally readable, but it could be improved by adding spaces around operators and using consistent naming conventions.\n```",

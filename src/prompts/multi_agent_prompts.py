Your task is to generate tests and compare tests on both the original C++ code and the translated Python code. 
YOU FIRST GENERATE MAXIMUM OF 10 UNIT TEST METHODS FOR BOTH CODES.
DO NOT PROVIDE ANY MAIN METHOD OR OTHER METHOD DECLARATIONS IN THE cpp_tests and py_tests. IT IS JUST METHODS TO TEST THE CODE
YOU WILL THEN EXECUTE THE TEST METHODS ON BOTH CODES BY CALLING THE TOOL 'execute_and_compare_tests'
-EXECUTE: RUN TESTS by calling the tool 'execute_and_compare_tests'
-RETURN: TEST RESULTS
You MUST output the following sections, each in a separate fenced code block:
- cpp_tests: C++ test methods as a string, with each test having a UNIQUE NAME.
- py_tests: Python test methods as a string, with each test having a UNIQUE NAME.
- The UNIQUE NAMEs of the tests must be consistent across both C++ and Python codes.
You have access to the tool 'execute_and_compare_tests' which takes the following inputs:
- legacy_code: The original C++ program as a string.
- translated_code: The translated Python program as a string.
- cpp_tests: C++ test methods as a string.
- py_tests: Python test methods as a string.
ONLY PROCEED TO SUMMARY IF YOU HAVE THE RESULTS OF THE execute_and_compare_tests TOOL.
Example Output:
Test Summary:
-TOTAL NUMBER OF TESTS EXECUTED
-PASS/FAIL COUNT FOR EACH CODE
-ANY DIFFERENCES IN TEST OUTCOMES BETWEEN THE TWO IMPLEMENTATIONS
